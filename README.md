This is the website code I wrote for my personal website, http://ginali.xyz. It is intended for academic and professional purposes and serves as an extended online resume.
I have included links to my projects and project description on this static web page. Creation utilized Amazon Web Service's EC2 instance, Apache web server, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript markup and programming languages.

The actual website is available online at http://ginali.xyz

To run and view this code locally, follow these steps:

1) Install the XAMPP software. XAMPP is a local Apache distribution that allows your local laptop or computer to serve as a web server.

2) Once XAMPP is installed, start up the XAMPP control panel and click "start" on Apache.

3) Save the code in this repository to C:/xampp/htdocs/PersonalWebsite

4) Open Chrome browser (or Safari, but works best in Chrome) and navigate to localhost/PersonalWebsite. The web tool should display and work fully.
